# Automate End of Duty Tasks Windows

This repository is an addition to the [automate_end_of_duty_tasks](https://github.com/moka-guys/automate_end_of_duty_tasks) repository!

The `process_duty_email.py`python, and `get_file_and_extract.ps1` and `get_DNAnexus_url.ps1` PowerShell scripts are required to download files using the URL links located in the CSV files that are generated by the `automate_EODT.py` script in the [automate_end_of_duty_tasks](https://github.com/moka-guys/automate_end_of_duty_tasks) repository.

These scripts are located on the Guy's and St Thomas' Trust computer at the following location: 

~~~
S:\Genetics_Data2\Array\Software\duty_bioinformatician_scripts
~~~

This script can be added to the PowerShell Profile on the trsut computer by following the instructions located in this KB article:

~~~

Once the PowerShell Profile has been set up, to run the script simply open the PowerShell and type:
