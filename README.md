# Automate End of Duty Tasks

The script searches the DNAnexus for recently created production projects '002_' and generates download links that are saved to a .csv file. 

An email is sent to the Duty Bioinformatican with instruction of how to download the files to the appropriate locations on the GST-Trust network. 

The script supports the following projects:
### WES
### TSO500
### SNP
### MokaPipe
